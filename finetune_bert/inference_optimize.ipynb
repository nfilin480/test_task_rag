    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. Analyze the query carefully.\n",
    "2. If the query requires specific, detailed, or specialized external information (e.g., fact-checking, detailed data, or precise terminology), label it as \"1\" (retrieval needed).\n",
    "3. If the query is generic, abstract, or related to tasks like summarization, paraphrasing, or general knowledge that can be answered by a language model without external data, label it as \"0\" (retrieval not needed).\n",
    "4. Provide your answer in the following format: \n",
    "   <label><0 or 1></label>\n",
    "   <explanation><one or two sentences explaining your reasoning></explanation>\n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "Query: When did Virgin Australia start operating?\n",
    "<label>1</label>\n",
    "<explanation>This query asks for a specific historical fact (a start date) that is unlikely to be deduced purely from context and requires external factual data.</explanation>\n",
    "\n",
    "Query: Which is a species of fish? Tope or Rope\n",
    "<label>1</label>\n",
    "<explanation>The query requires knowing the correct fish species between two options, which is a precise factual lookup rather than a generic or inferable answer.</explanation>\n",
    "\n",
    "Query: Alice's parents have three daughters: Amy, Jessy, and what’s the name of the third daughter?\n",
    "<label>0</label>\n",
    "<explanation>This is a riddle where the answer is directly given in the query (\"Alice\"), making external retrieval unnecessary.</explanation>\n",
    "\n",
    "Query: What individual has won the most Olympic gold medals in the history of the games?\n",
    "<label>1</label>\n",
    "<explanation>This is a specific fact-based question that requires up-to-date and precise information about Olympic records, which typically necessitates an external data source.</explanation>\n",
    "\n",
    "Query: Which Dutch artist painted “Girl with a Pearl Earring”?\n",
