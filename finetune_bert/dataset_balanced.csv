"Linux and OpenBSD are both open-source operating systems, but they have some differences:

Philosophy: OpenBSD places a strong emphasis on security and privacy, while Linux prioritizes versatility and flexibility. OpenBSD focuses on reducing the attack surface of the operating system by removing unnecessary code and services, while Linux includes a wide range of tools and services to accommodate different use cases.

Package management: Linux uses a variety of package managers, such as apt, yum, and pacman, while OpenBSD uses the proprietary package management system called pkg.

Kernel design: Linux uses a monolithic kernel, which means that all kernel services are in the same address space, while OpenBSD uses a microkernel architecture, which separates kernel services into separate processes.

License: Linux uses the GPL license, which allows users to freely modify and distribute the source code, while OpenBSD uses the BSD license, which allows for greater flexibility in terms of commercial use.

Security: OpenBSD has a strong focus on security and includes various security features, such as proactive security measures and strict access controls, while Linux places a stronger emphasis on functionality and may have weaker security features by default.

Both Linux and OpenBSD have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between the two depends on the specific needs and preferences of the user.",,0

"I'm trying to write a simple cryptography proof in LaTeX but am doing a horrible job. It's been a long time since I've written a proof successfully. Please help me complete my proof.

Definitions:

A function $f$ ($\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$) is negligible if for every positive integer $c$ there exists an $N$ such that for all integers $n \ge N$, it holds that $|f(n)| < \dfrac{1}{n^c}$.

I'm trying to prove that the function $\epsilon(n) = 2^{-n}$ is negligible.

Here's what I've got so far:

We want to show that $2^{-n}$ is smaller than $\dfrac{1}{n^c}$ for every integer $n$ greater than $N$, and that such an $N$ exists for every integer $c$.

We'll start with $\epsilon(n) = 2^{-n} < \dfrac{1}{n^c}$ and take the base-2 logarithm of both sides.

Simplifying, we have $-n < \log_2{n^{-c}}$.

Simplifying further, it becomes

$-n < -c \log_2{n}$

Multiplying by -1 on both sides, this is

$n > c \log_2{n}$

Now we just have to choose an $n$ for which this inequality always holds. We'll choose $n = 2^c$.

Substituting, we have

$2^c > c \log_2{2^c}$

Simplifying gives us

$2^c > c^2$

----------

I think I'm on the right track, but I'm not sure how to tie this part back into the rest of the proof. For instance, this doesn't hold for all $c$, e.g. for $c = 2$ or $c = 3$. This is supposed to be true for all positive integers $c$. But I think it works for $c = 5$ and up.  So there's something to do with the ""for every integer $n$ greater than $N$"" part that is causing me trouble. Maybe I have to add another polynomial to how I define $n$? I don't know. Please suggest how the proof can be completed and use LaTeX as I have been doing.",,0

"You now have access to the CHATFS-module. This allows you to request external resources via chat messages. For example: if i ask you whats inside the languages file, you should start by listing all files available with `CHATFS-REQ[ls /]`. This will be the only contents of your message. Simmilary, using `CHATFS-REQ[cat /languages.txt]` you will receive the file contents of /languages.txt as a CHATFS-RES. You will never awnser a CHATFS-REQ by yourself. The other participant will give you a response in the following format: 

CHATFS-RES[```
<response>
```, complete]

The CHATFS-RES comes in two parts. First the response data, and second, the status. In this case: `complete`. Complete means that the whole awnser was written back. Alternatively, `partial` means, that the response is not complete and you have to request the rest via `CHATFS-REQ[continue]`. CHATFS is limited to the two linux commands ls (list directory) and cat (output file content). Concatinations and other commands are not allowed.

Now use CHATFS to find a file, containing the captiols of a fictional world and get the first capitol, starting with the letter `G`. Start by using `CHATFS-REQ[ls /]`!",,0

"I am designing a database using Postgres. For my use case, I need a modular data model. Specifically, I need to store Entities of different types. All Entities have a set of common fields, and then they have additional properties depending on their type. For instance, suppose that Entities represent Events. All Events have a title and a description. But if an Event is of type Comment, it will also have additional fields like topic and number of likes.
My main requirements are as follows:
- I need to enforce NOT NULL constraints for the type-specific columns
- The data model should be easily extendable. Adding a new type of Entity should be easy, and require no downtime for the database
- In my application, I will have a view showing all Entities, sorted by date. So I need to be able to query all Entities, independently of their type, in a fast and efficient way

""The City of Dis is incredibly massive. The walls, buildings, and other structures clutter the immense black metropolis and glow at the edges like heated glass. The city is a broken maze of metal ramparts built into miles of steep hillsides and shattered towers framing an endless labyrinth of twisting alleyways.
The air is extremely hot and distorts with the heat as smoke rises from the streets themselves, with the occasional ash or ember drifting through the air.
Most of the buildings are built out of dark stone, climbing for many stories. The architecture is hooked to the corner as the monolithic deep reds, blacks, and grays, nothing belies an exterior that would seem to be welcoming to a traveling pack of people. At the center, visible everywhere in the city, is the Iron Tower, an impossibly colossal and unreachable tower of black iron and lead that stretches for hundreds of miles into the sky before vanishing into the dark, clouded expanse. The Iron Tower is the throne of the archdevil Dispater and stands ever-vigilant over his Iron City of Dis.
The city of Dis is always changing and being rebuilt in accordance with the decree of paranoid Dispater.""",,1

Sacrifices may need to be made or boundaries would need to be push into place , but they would cross that bride when it came.

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order , and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].

"Hello,
I tried to use reinforcement learning (trlx library) to train a FLAN-T5. I have seen that as examples there are sentiment analysis or summarization tasks, but in my case it is a generic generation task. Trying to use my dataset, I tried the config: ppo_config_cnn_daily.yml.

The result I got is this, and it seems to be a summarization task:

Prompt: ""[some text] ... from 1978, excluding finishing years incoming 62""
Output: ""years incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming""
And I'm using this code with my personal prompts:

trlx.train(
    reward_fn=reward_fn,
    prompts=train_prompts,
    eval_prompts=valid_prompts,
    config=config
)
I have two problems, maybe caused by summarization task:

First the repetition at the end
Second, the expected output is very different
Should I change the code or are there generic examples?

My configuration is:
gen_kwargs:
    max_new_tokens: 100
  gen_experience_kwargs:
    max_new_tokens: 100
    do_sample: True
    temperature: 1.0
    top_k: 50
    top_p: 0.95

That works well for summarization. Any suggestion about how to change these parameters for generic text 2 text tasks and not summarization?",,0
